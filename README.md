# Thai White Rice 5% Price Forecasting

## Overview

Rice is not just food—it's a cornerstone for over half the world's population and a critical economic crop for millions of farmers and traders. In regions where agriculture forms the backbone of the economy, price volatility in rice can have far-reaching effects, influencing farmers’ livelihoods, consumer affordability, and food security. 

This project focuses on forecasting Thai White Rice 5% prices to help mitigate these challenges. Accurate predictions can inform smarter decisions in trade, agriculture, and policymaking, contributing to a more resilient and equitable food supply chain.

## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to predict the future price of Thai White Rice 5% using data-driven forecasting methods, including Machine Learning approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks. 

### Key Features:

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Incorporates predictors such as weather conditions, exchange rates, and the prices of other rice types based on domain knowledge.
- **Forecasting Models**: Utilises advanced time-series analysis and machine learning techniques to predict rice prices.
- **Visualization**: Detailed visualizations of the data, methodology, and prediction results.

## Project Structure

The main analysis, methods, and results are documented in `src/ChanopSethiwanA0296969WAssignmentFinal.ipynb`. This repository began as a university project but will be expanded further:

- **More frequent and diverse rice price data**.
- **Additional predictors**.
- **Enhanced forecasting techniques**.

## Future Work

Planned improvements include integrating additional data sources, refining the prediction models, and exploring novel methods for greater forecasting accuracy.
